	<p>&nbsp; 
		The Develop Module is the second most-used core Module in Lightroom. Plenty of photographers will rarely, if ever, go past it to other modules. But if you’re using Lightroom, there’s a good chance that you started using it because of the Develop Module. The Library Module is something you take time to learn to use and appreciate. Without a doubt, this is the most important Module of Lightroom where you will be spending the majority of your time. It has a set of very useful, powerful and ergonomically laid out tools that are specifically tailored for editing images.

		Starting off with the left-side panel, we have the Presets tab. Presets are extremely useful in speeding up your workflow. In this tab, you can create, organize and import/export Presets. To learn all there is to know about them, read our article on “How to Manage Presets“. The left-side panel also includes some basic Library Module functionality – you can switch between different Collections. This is useful in several ways. Most notably, it’s a very time-saving addition, much like the basic Exposure and White Balance settings in the Library Module. You see, these two Modules are both extremely important and you will find yourself switching from one to another very often. Thus, having them share a small amount of basic functions is time-saving. Once you’ve properly organized your images in the Library Module, you won’t have to switch to it just to select images from a different event to post-process. You can do that by choosing a different Collection from the Develop Module, provided that you use Collections to organize your images in the first place.

	<p>&nbsp;
		Filmstrip at the bottom of the screen includes the usual navigation. As in the Library Module, some filtering options are also available – you can view images by rating, flags or color labels. Assigning these filters to specific images is very easy with the help of keyboard shortcuts.
	</p>
	<p>&nbsp;
		The largest number of tools is found on the right-side panel. In fact, nowhere else in Lightroom will you find such a huge amount of sliders and numbers to enter. This is where all the post-processing magic happens, from exposure tweaks to sharpening, noise reduction, tone curve, lens corrections, you name it. At the top of the panel you will find the ever-useful histogram and right under it, a list of area-specific tools for local adjustments and cropping.
