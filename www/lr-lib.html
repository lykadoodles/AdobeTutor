	<p>&nbsp; 
		The Library Module is one of two core Modules you will be spending the most time in. As the name suggests, Library is there to help you organize and manage photographs. Everything you need to help you find, import, sort and organize photographs is here. Navigation options are located on the left-side panel. This panel grants access to all images within the current Catalog. You can also choose to browse them by source Folder or Collection. To manage folders and physically move or copy image files, use the Folder tab. In addition to all of that, you can publish your images to online services with the help of “Publish Services” tab at the bottom of the left-side panel.

	<p>
		The central portion of Library Module is dominated by the image display. You can choose to view images in a resizable grid or one photograph at a time. These and other view options are located on a toolbar (hit “T” to toggle) above the Filmstrip. A few filter options can be found on the Filmstrip, such as Flags and Color Labels. For more filters, hit the “\” button to toggle the filter bar. It acts as a very powerful search tool. The filter bar allows you to search images by specifying lenses, focal lengths, aperture, camera, keywords or other criteria.
	</p>
	<p>
		The right-side panel is your metadata tool. Here, you can add keywords and copyright information, as well as specify which metadata details to keep. Since you will most likely use the Library Module to sort through photographs and separate the good ones from the bad, the right-side panel also includes a small number of basic image adjustments. They are limited to Presets and basic White Balance, Exposure, Clarity and Vibrance controls. Do note that these controls are not suitable for precise fine-tuning, but for minor tweaks only. You can hardly ever use them for more than previewing purposes (approximate white balance or exposure correction, for example).
