	<p>&nbsp; 
		Adobe Photoshop Lightroom has a very extensive list of tools available. It may not be as powerful as Photoshop for certain things, but when it comes to anything photography related, the latest version of Lightroom has some of the best built-in capabilities for image editing. Naturally, Adobe had to figure out a way to ensure all the functionality is conveniently accessible, and yet not overwhelming at the same time. So instead of dumping everything into one place and creating a mess, they came up with the concept of Modules.
	</p>
	<p>
		Basically, each Module is an independent section that contains a set of tools relevant only to that particular module. In other words, it is a way to group and organize different tools together. Within the Lightroom environment, you navigate between different Modules depending on your needs. For example, for organizing images and publishing an online photo gallery, you would switch to the Web Module, because the tools to create an online gallery reside in that specific module.
